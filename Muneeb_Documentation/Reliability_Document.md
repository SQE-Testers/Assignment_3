## Problems solved by Cloud

- Slow Performance 
- Lack of Flexibility
- Enhanced Scalability 
- Security

## Kubernetes & Google Cloud Platform
We use the Kubernetes - the best, Google-originated orchestration tool globally - and team it with Google Cloud Platform. It facilitates large-scale eCommerce run as fast as possible.

## Scalability 
Cloud-native infrastructure enables to handle dynamic traffic peaks by automatically adding or removing resources. This model leaves merchants confident that their webshops always meet current demands in terms of organic traffic.

## Reliability 
support team provides daily backups, which makes testing new solutions safely. Daily backups by default makes business consistency perfectly secured. With daily back we will have our data secured. So for example if someone tries to attack our system then we still have our data and we can use it.
No one can black mail us.Moreover if one component is down then other componenets remain intact and can be used.

## CDN
Google Cloud CDN supports modern protocols initially developed at Google, like HTTP/2 and QUIC. These protocols have the ability to serve the thousands of requests per day and hence help in load balancing.

## Automatic deployments
Each deployment is managed via storefrontcloud-cli and the GitLab repository. We are using a fully automatic deployment flow with the evidence of changes (git-log) and a simple restore process in case of any failure.
